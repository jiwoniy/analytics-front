css(scss) conventsion
=============

There is no constraint with regard to css rules. It only provides a guide for readability and reusability.

> use nouns as much as possible.

> use hyphen-naming syntax

> use both the scss and css grammar properly.
If you are using only one side, readability is not good.

- identifier class
  - __section
  - __container
  - __wrapper
  - __button
